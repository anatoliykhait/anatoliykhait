# Welcome to our group

We study complex nonlinear phenomena in fluid mechanics.
Our main focus is on ocean waves dynamics and transport processes in upper ocean layer.
We are also interested in mass and heat exchange in strongly turbulent flows.

### Main research interests:
- a
- b




```
M.Sc./Ph.D./Postdoc students are wanted.

We are continuously seeking highly motivated and talented students interested in multidisciplinary research in the fields related to fluid mechanics.

For further information please contact Dr. Anatoliy Khait at:
