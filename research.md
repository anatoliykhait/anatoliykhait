### Mass and energy exchange in the upper ocean layer

Ocean upper layer plays a key role in the global energy balance influencing both
atmosphere flows and ocean currents. In this fundamental study, we attempt to understand
the role of the surface gravity waves in the energy and mass exchange at the ocean upper layer scale.

### Kinematics of nonlinear extreme waves

Breaking of ocean waves is the dominant mechanism to dissipate the kinetic energy
stored in the ocean due to its interaction with the atmosphere.
The mechanism of a single wave crest destabilization is complex and significantly nonlinear.
Moreover, kinematics of an extreme wave is important for the prediction of structural loading
on coastal and offshore structures.
This fundamental study is focused on the kinematics of extreme pre-breaking waves.

### Wave generation and interaction with submerged solids

Wavemakers are used to generate surface waves in laboratory flumes worldwide.
The simplest linear wavemaker theory was first derived in 1929.
Since then multiple corrections bringing different nonlinear effects to consideration
were suggested and tested. Nonetheless, a significant inaccuracy in wave generation still exists.
In this study, analytic developments are combined with high-fidelity numerical simulations
to get an insight into the missed puzzle pieces in the wavemaker theory.

### Energy and mass transfer in strongly turbulent flows

Energy exchange in turbulent flows is dominated by convection. Proper simulation
of all turbulent scales is infeasible by the use of the most advanced computation clusters.
To facilitate the computations, the small scale mass and energy exchange is taken into account
by the so-called turbulent conductivity, which is an artificial effect governed
by the semi-empirical turbulent models. Recently we have shown that an additional
energy exchange due to the fluid compressibility is important in the transonic vortex flows.
